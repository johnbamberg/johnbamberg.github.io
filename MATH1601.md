# MATH1601 Mathematics: from the Renaissance to Modern Day

[Here](http://school.maths.uwa.edu.au/~bamberg/MATH1601promo.mp4) is a short video about MATH1601. In particular, this unit is suitable for a student that

- is interested in the historical and cultural backdrop to mathematics;
- is interested in learning beautiful mathematics
- has not done much mathematics in the senior level of secondary school

There are no prerequisites for MATH1601, and it makes an ideal broadening unit for any of the degrees at UWA. 

For 2019, the content of MATH1601 will comprise of the following subjects

## The Mathematics of Perspective Art ##

 - A brief history of mathematics, Euclid's Elements
 - Arabic maths, Florence, Intro to perspective 
 - Humanism (esp. Petrarch), Leon Battista Alberti and "Della Pittura"
 - The Invention of the Observer, Alberti's visual pyramid, Alberti's rule "costruzione legittima" , one-point perspective
 - Orthogonals, transversals, properties of central projection
 - The vanishing point, convergence of parallel lines, pavemento 
 - Perspective projection 
 - Piero della Francesca, anamorphosis
 - Guidobaldo del Monte, Vanishing Point Theorem, Main Theorem on Perspective
 - Kepler, Desargues, conic sections, points at infinity, cross-ratio
