# About Me

Most of my life, I have lived in Victoria ([Kinglake area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinglake,_Victoria)), Australia, completing my undergraduate degree at La Trobe University (in 1999). My honours thesis was on combinatorial group theory and was supervised by [Grant Cairns](http://grantcairns.ltumathstats.com). I then relocated to Perth, Western Australia for my PhD under the auspices of [Cheryl Praeger](http://www.uwa.edu.au/people/cheryl.praeger) and [Tim Penttila](http://www.math.colostate.edu/~penttila). My PhD thesis was titled _Innately Transitive Groups_ which was a study of finite permutation groups which contain a transitive minimal normal subgroup (a kind of generalisation of the Oâ€™Nan-Scott theory for primitive and quasiprimitive groups). 

I then shared an Australian Research Council grant with Tim Penttila which employed me as a research fellow for nearly 3 years in Perth where I began research on problems in [finite geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_geometry). The main focus of our research was on m-systems, eggs, elation generalised quadrangles, and extremal configurations of polar spaces (tight sets and m-ovoids). In September 2006, I began research in [Ghent](http://cage.ugent.be/geometry), Belgium, joining the world renown Incidence Geometry group. I was employed on a Marie Curie Incoming International Fellowship, for which [Frank De Clerck](http://cage.ugent.be/~fdc/) was the chief investigator, and I was also supported by a GOA grant. In 2009, I returned to UWA and was a research associate supported by an ARC grant with [Michael Giudici](http://www.uwa.edu.au/people/michael.giudici) and [Gordon Royle](http://www.uwa.edu.au/people/gordon.royle). From 2012 to 2016, I was an ARC Future Fellow, working on applications of algebraic combinatorics to problems in finite geometry. Since December 2016, I have been a teaching and research staff member in the UWA School of Maths & Stats.
