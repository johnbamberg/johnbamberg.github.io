# Research projects

One of the things I most like about my job is supervising students in research projects. From [AMSI](https://amsi.org.au) Vacation Scholarship students to honours students to PhD students, I enjoy collaborating with a student that is seeing a dedicated research problem for the first time, and then becoming a master of their subject.

For PhD supervision, I require that the student know me first: too often do I receive an email from someone who wants to do a PhD in, say, fluid mechanics with me; a subject I have very little idea about! I also require proof that you are capable of research at a high level. This gruelling test consists of asking the student to write a difficult proof in exquisitely written english on a result of my choosing. So if you are interested in doing a PhD with me, send me an informal chatty email (formal emails will be deleted), and the areas of my research that you are interested in.

Prospective honours students, I have outlined what I think you need to know in making an informed decision on whether you want to work under my supervision. The styles of projects can be roughly categorised as follows:  

- A scholarly investigation that demands a lot of learning on a subject that is not taught in undergraduate. This is not an `instant-starter' and would mean the student does a lot of reading on a subject before embarking on a research problem. In most instances, the research problem will not be known from the beginning but will evolve organically from a deep understanding of the subject. The main objective is to produce a dissertation that gives a summary of the research area that allows someone else of a similar background entry into the area.  
- An **instant-starter** means that I have up my sleeve a problem in combinatorics, number theory, or group theory that requires little background and the student can start thinking about straight away. However, this rarely happens! Ask me if I have such a problem; most years I won't.
- Computational enumeration problems are excellent problems for honours students as they learn a subject (like projective geometry) by a needs basis. This style of project requires the student to have an affinity with computer programming and at least feel that they are "good" at programming. The project would usually consist of searching for examples, exhaustive search of examples, and analysing the results with the mathematics they have learned. 

As for research areas, here is how I describe them for a student:

### Group theory

I am mainly interested in finite permutation groups, but I sometimes offer a project where my curiosity has taken me beyond the finite realm. The project is likely to be an abstract investigation and be co-supervised with another member of our research group; the [Centre for the Mathematics of Symmetry and Computation](www.cmsc.io) are world-renown for their strengths in finite group theory.

### Geometry

My research has mostly been in finite projective or polar geometry, generalised polygons, and related structures. Recently I have been interested in the foundations of geometry and the [Bachmann](http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Bachmann_Friedrich.html) school of metric geometry. I have plenty of nice problems in incidence geometry, and this would be my comfort zone in terms of supervision.

### Algebraic Combinatorics

The use of [association schemes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_scheme) has recently been very successful in the existence and non-existence questions of substructures in finite geometry. This currently a hot topic of mine that I have many side-projects on the fly. There are interesting avenues for computational investigation in this area.

### Elementary number theory

First a disclaimer: I am not a number theorist, and I cannot pretend to be at the cutting edge of modern number theory. A lot of students are easily swayed by the beauty of this subject, however, the modern day number theory is quite a deep and complicated profession. The research projects I would offer under this heading would not be cutting edge research problems, only curiosities that have come up in my day-to-day research. If you would like a problem that trains you to be at the forefront of modern research in number theory, there is an excellent group at Macuqarie University and ANU that I would suggest you contact. However, if you like the "style" of mathematics of number theory, then you might also like "combinatorics" too, and we can certainly offer projects under that broad heading.
